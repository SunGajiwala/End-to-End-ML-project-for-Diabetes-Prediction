## Diabetes Prediction
### Introduction

Diabetes is a disease that has no permanent cure; hence early detection is required. Data mining, machine learning (ML) algorithms methods are used in diabetes prediction in our research. We used the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset for our research, collected from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about 768 patients and their corresponding nine unique attributes. We used seven ML algorithms on the dataset to predict diabetes. We found that the model with Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC) worked well for the considered dataset. 

In this project we use four different machine learning models. The model was then deployed using Flask. 
 
**We divided the project into three phases:**

Phase 1: Research and Information gathering.

Phase 2: Implementation using python

Phase 3: Documentation

### Methodolody

The problem we have at hand is binary classification. So, we decided to use four different supervised learning algorithms to create our ML model.

**•	K-Nearest Neighbors:** The KNN algorithm is a non-parametric technique used for classification.

**•	Logistic Regression:** It is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.

**•	Support Vector Machines:**  SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outlier detection.

**•	Random Forest Classifier:** It is an ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

### Results

As we are using supervised learning classification models, accuracy is the best metric for evaluating our model. 

1. K-Nearest Neighbor	: **87.01 %** Accuracy Score
2. Logistic Regression: **83.11 %** Accuracy Score
3. Support Vector Machines: **88.96 %** Accuracy Score
4.  Random Forest Classifier: **85.71 %** Accuracy Score

```
The conclusion drawn from this project is that, SVM is the best fit model for the considered problem.
